## 1. Text of the question copied here

### a. If there is a subquestion, use this with three ###'s 


```{r}
a = (2+2)^2
print(a)
```

Your answer to the first question. Replace this text with your own. 


## 2. Text of next question copied here

```{r}
# Your code for 1B here.
```

Your answer to the second question/subquestion goes here. If it's only asking you to code and there is no blue "Question", then you can just say "no question" here.



You're on your own for the structure here on out. When you make a new section with the two or three hashtags (pound signs), they have to be at the beginning of the line - no spaces before them. Check your work. Delete this sentence before rendering your final PDF.
